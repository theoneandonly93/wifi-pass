Hi Friends,

[Solomon Foskaay](https://twitter.com/SolomonFoskaay) of dPU (dProgramming University) here. While researching and testing out things to build full stack dApp on Solana powered by Solang Solidity smart contract, I figure out a lot of Solidity developers transitioning from Ethereum/EVM Blockchains will need boilerplates tailored for Solidity.

I discovered and forked this amazing [dApp Scafford](https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold) by Solana Labs and then go further to remove the Rust-based Anchor program set up in it and replace it with Solang Anchor program for Solidity.

Hopefully, you find it helpful to kickstart your Solidity Solana full dApp development faster too.

## How To Use This Solidity Solana Full Stack dApp Nextjs Boilerplate

It is easier to use following the steps below:

1. Clone this repo with this command in your terminal `git clone https://github.com/dProgrammingUniversity/solidity-solana-full-stack-dapp-nextjs-boilerplate.git`

2. Then run the command `cd solidity-solana-full-stack-dapp-nextjs-boilerplate`

3. Once you are in the clone repo, open it in your code editor. If using VS code, then run this command in the same terminal to auto-open the folder in VScode `Code .`

4. There are 2 folders there. The `app` is for frontend of the dApp (Nextjs) while the `program` folder is for the backend Solana on-chain program powered by Solang Solidity (also where you can write your Solidity smart contract)

5. To run the `app` frontend , run `cd app` and `pnpm install` and then `pnpm dev` to run the application in your browser and track changes via `http://localhost:3000`

6. To write, build, deploy and test a Solang Solidity smart contract to deploy on Solana Blockchain, run `cd program` and `yarn install` and then `anchor test`.

Meanwhile, I have also done a walkthrough video to help even further, watch below:

## Stucked & Need Support?

I have created a dedicated `Solana` channel under `BLOCKCHAINS` in the official [dPU Discord Server](https://dProgrammingUniversity.com/Discord) where you get support for all Solana-related courses, articles, videos and boilerplate created by dPU team!

## Recommended Solang Solidity Resources

I have created some beginner-friendly content to get you started as a Solidity developer transitioning from Ethereum/EVM Blockchains to Solana (and continue to add more).

So, check below to get started:

1. [Ultimate Guide To Solidity For Solana Programs Development with Solang And Anchor](https://dprogramminguniversity.com/solana/ultimate-guide-to-solidity-for-solana-programs-development-with-solang-and-anchor/)

2. [Solang Solidity Solana Program Examples Codes Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQt4yZ_0i3k&list=PL8wScYxE1DQAzhUb1-0qBV2z6t4HUEzrS)

## Contribution

Open to contribution.

Kindly open an `Issue` first and then mention it in a `PR`.

NOTE: Issues are not the right place to get support, kindly join our Solana support channel in the Discord server above.

## What Next?

I am working on using this Solang Solidity Solana boilerplate to create real live full-stack dApps and would be sharing with you how they are built step-by-step.
